title: Sales Fails
---
Selling is hard. We've been trying to improve our sales process at ShareLaTeX for the past 6 months to a year, and we've sadly got very little to show for it. What we've tried:

* A dedicated univesity sales page.
* Telling students/staff to recommend ShareLaTeX for their university so they can get it for free.
* Group accounts on the individual plans page.

What we're trying at the moment/soon:

* A new dedicated univesity sales page.
* An onsite installation version, linked from our open source repository.
* Targetted email campaigns to direct 'decision makers' to our group accounts and uni sales page, with a claimed discount.
* Encourage students to sign a 'petition' to get ShareLaTeX at their university, and then send a link to the signed petition to their supervisor/head of dept.

Why I think selling group and big site licenses doesn't work well:

* Only one or two people in a research group are hardcore LaTeX/ShareLaTeX users. They get a personal account and that does everything they need for their whole group. No one else is interested in organising and actively using their ShareLaTeX account, they just drop into it when they're collaborating with the person with the paid individual account.
* We are asking them to pay for something which has many free alternatives, such as just continuing as they are, using our open source version, or using free accounts as much as possible (perhaps with a few paid accounts).
* The people who can buy or easily authorise big licenses are not the on-the-ground LaTeX users. They are more 'admin' roles, and will make purchases based on serious pressure from the dept, established university workflows, or 'enterprise' reasons like doing better at REF. ShareLaTeX doesn't really create any of these.

So, what next?
